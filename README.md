## Mini Python Projects  

This repository contains three simple Python programs:  

- **Chat Application:** A basic Python chat system that allows two users to exchange messages in real time.  
- **BMI Calculator:** A small program that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on height and weight inputs.  
- **Random Password Generator:** A script that creates secure passwords using random letters, numbers, and symbols.  

Each project is written in Python and demonstrates simple logic, user interaction, and functional design.
